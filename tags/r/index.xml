      <description>Background Inspired by James Cheshire&amp;rsquo;s Population Lines Print and Ryan Brideau, I wanted to track the spatial Pattern of the COVID-19 in Germany over time. This map shows the density of confirmed cases COVID-19 cases by latitude.
The data comes from the covid19germany package, which was developed in the context of the #WirvsVirus hackathon. The package loads the data from the Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie as well as the Robert Koch Institut.</description>

      <description>RStudio RStudio1 is (most likely, are there any numbers out there?) the most widespread IDE for R. However, getting more and more submerged into the R shiny world there was always a bit of a hassle toying around with R, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I was using VisualStudio Code for my blog and Jupyter notebooks and recently saw a tweet from Miles McBain explaining how he integrated RStudio Addins in VSCode.</description>

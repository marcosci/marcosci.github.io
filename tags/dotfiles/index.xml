      <description>Background So, spatial data is sometimes a pain. It&amp;rsquo;s messy, there are a quadrillion file formats and &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s huge. It is often really, really big. Like &amp;hellip; terrabytes big. But even if it&amp;rsquo;s smaller, it is in most cases way to big to use it in web applications. To circumvent this, you can use tools like mapbox and upload your data to their platform and let it be served via the web from there.</description>

I was using VisualStudio Code for my blog and Jupyter notebooks and recently saw a tweet from Miles McBain explaining how he integrated RStudio Addins in VSCode.</description>

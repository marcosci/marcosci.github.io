      <description>Background So, spatial data is sometimes a pain. It&amp;rsquo;s messy, there are a quadrillion file formats and &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s huge. It is often really, really big. Like &amp;hellip; terrabytes big. But even if it&amp;rsquo;s smaller, it is in most cases way to big to use it in web applications. To circumvent this, you can use tools like mapbox and upload your data to their platform and let it be served via the web from there.</description>

      <description>Background Inspired by James Cheshire&amp;rsquo;s Population Lines Print and Ryan Brideau, I wanted to track the spatial Pattern of the COVID-19 in Germany over time. This map shows the density of confirmed cases COVID-19 cases by latitude.
The data comes from the covid19germany package, which was developed in the context of the #WirvsVirus hackathon. The package loads the data from the Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie as well as the Robert Koch Institut.</description>

      <description>RStudio RStudio1 is (most likely, are there any numbers out there?) the most widespread IDE for R. However, getting more and more submerged into the R shiny world there was always a bit of a hassle toying around with R, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I was using VisualStudio Code for my blog and Jupyter notebooks and recently saw a tweet from Miles McBain explaining how he integrated RStudio Addins in VSCode.</description>
